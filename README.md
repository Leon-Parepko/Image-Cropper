# Image-Cropper

    V 1.4 alpha

This is a simple program, with graphical interface,
which was constructed to prepare images for printing
in separate paper lists. You could configure slice,
border and color settings to print your pictures in
higher (physical) resolution. The program supports
operating on multiple files (in same directory) at
the same time. Also, you could use console mode to
perform operations faster and with higher performance.
